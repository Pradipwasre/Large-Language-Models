# Customer Support App

This project leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Langchain to build an intelligent customer support application. By combining prompt engineering and Langchain components, we aim to automate and enhance the support experience, allowing efficient problem-solving through AI.

## 1. Power of LLMs

Language models are revolutionizing problem-solving, enabling automation of complex tasks with ease. By using **prompt engineering**, we can harness this power effectively.

### Key Features:
- **Pre-Trained LLMs**: These models can generalize to unseen tasks, making them highly adaptable for a wide range of applications.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Carefully designed prompts guide the LLM to produce relevant and accurate responses.

### Anatomy of a Prompt
A well-constructed prompt consists of the following components:
- **Context / Background**: Setup that clarifies intent, role play, expertise, or examples.
- **Instructions**: Specifics on what and how to perform the task (e.g., "Explain in simple language" or "Provide the output in a table format").
- **Task**: The action, such as creating, summarizing, solving, or responding.
- **Refine**: Follow-up validations, modifications, or additional clarifications.

### Example Prompt Breakdown:

1. **Context**: "You are an AI assistant with expertise in customer support. You will help solve technical issues."
2. **Instructions**: "Explain the process of resetting a router to an 8-year-old in simple steps."
3. **Task**: "Provide a step-by-step guide on how to reset the router."
4. **Refine**: "If the user asks about troubleshooting further, suggest calling their ISP for help."

## 2. Langchain

**Langchain** provides a powerful framework for building complex applications by chaining together different components. It simplifies integration between various modules and tools, which can be combined to enhance AI-driven tasks.

### Langchain Modules:
1. **Prompt Template**: Pre-defined prompts to ensure consistency and context across interactions.
2. **LLMs**: The core language models that handle the heavy lifting of generating responses.
3. **Agents**: Specialized logic flows that decide what steps to take based on the input.
4. **Memory**: Used to maintain context between interactions and create more coherent, human-like dialogues.

### Agent and Tools Workflow:

1. **User Input**: The user asks a question.
2. **Agent**: Interprets the query and decides what to do.
3. **Tools**: (e.g., Database, Internet, Documentation) Used to search for relevant information.
4. **Agent Response**: The agent processes the retrieved data and provides a solution.

## 3. Langchain Documentation

Start with the **Langchain Cookbook** for examples and detailed instructions on how to use Langchain for a variety of applications. This is the ideal starting point for anyone looking to get hands-on experience with the library.

### Key Langchain Components:
- **Modules**: Modular components like prompt templates, agents, and memory, each serving different roles in the application architecture.
- **Langserve**: A deployment layer to serve Langchain models in production environments.
- **Langsmith**: A suite of development and debugging tools that allow you to test, trace, and improve your chains in real-time.

# Chain of Thought Prompting and Autonomous Systems with Langchain

In this section, we explore advanced prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and the ReACT framework. These techniques enhance LLM (Large Language Model) capabilities and help turn LLMs into more autonomous systems with the power of Langchain. We also introduce RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for better knowledge retrieval.

## Chain of Thoughts

**Standard Prompting Example:**

Model Input:

Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many total balls does he now have?

A: The answer is 11.



**Chain-of-Thought Prompting Example:**

Model Input:


Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many total balls does he now have?

A: Roger started with 5 balls. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each is 6 tennis balls. 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is 11.



### Benefits of Chain-of-Thought Prompting:
- **Step-by-Step Reasoning**: Guides the model to think step-by-step, improving problem-solving accuracy.
- **Improved Clarity**: Makes the thought process behind the solution more transparent.
- **Enhanced Performance**: Useful in more complex problem-solving scenarios where logical reasoning is essential.

## ReACT: Reasoning and Acting Framework

The ReACT approach enhances LLMs by combining **reasoning** and **acting**. It allows the language model not only to generate responses but also to perform actions in response to user queries.

### Example Scenario:
**User Input:**
When was the first successful heart transplant performed?



**ReACT Framework Response:**
1. Listen carefully to the user's input.
2. Search or retrieve relevant information.
3. Provide an accurate and detailed response.
4. Request more input if necessary to clarify or expand the response.

**Example Response**:

The first successful heart transplant was performed in 1967 by Dr. Christiaan Barnard in South Africa. The patient was 53-year-old Lewis Washkansky, who received the heart of a car accident victim.


### Turning LLMs into Autonomous Systems

Langchain utilizes the ReACT framework to create **agentic** systems. These agents can:
- **Interact with Tools**: Such as search engines, databases, or external APIs.
- **Perform Actions**: Based on reasoning and the provided inputs.

For example, an agent can retrieve information from a company database, perform calculations, or answer questions based on its findings.

## Langchain and ReACT

Langchain is a powerful framework for building AI applications that are both **data-aware** and **agentic**. It supports the ReACT paradigm by connecting LLMs to external tools and sources of data, enabling more advanced and autonomous behaviors.

### Langchain Enables Two Key Features:
1. **Data-Aware Systems**: Connecting the language model to external data sources (databases, documents, etc.) to enhance decision-making.
2. **Agentic Systems**: Allowing the LLM to interact with its environment, perform tasks, and return results autonomously.

**Example Use Case with ReACT + Langchain:**
An agent powered by Langchain can:
1. Receive a user query.
2. Decide which external tools or databases to consult.
3. Retrieve the relevant data.
4. Generate and deliver a final answer.

## RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation

**RAG** combines the strengths of LLMs with external knowledge sources through **Vector Search** and retrieval mechanisms.

### Process Flow:
1. **Vector Search**: Retrieves relevant documents from a database or knowledge repository based on the input query.
2. **LLM Response**: The LLM uses the retrieved information to generate a response, grounded in knowledge from the documents.

**Example Prompt:**


Prompt: Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

{context}

Question: What T-Shirt sizes are available? Answer: T-Shirts are available in S, M, L, and XL.



This approach ensures that the generated answer is both accurate and grounded in real data.

## Conclusion

By integrating **Chain-of-Thought prompting**, the **ReACT framework**, and **RAG** with **Langchain**, we can build more intelligent, data-aware, and autonomous AI systems. These systems can retrieve, reason, act, and respond in ways that were previously unattainable with standard language models alone.

Langchain provides the necessary tools and infrastructure to turn LLMs into highly capable agents, paving the way for more sophisticated AI applications in customer support, automation, and beyond.
