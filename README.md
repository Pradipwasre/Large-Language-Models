# **Large Language Models (LLM)**

## **What are Large Language Models and Why They Are Important**

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a class of machine learning models designed to understand, generate, and manipulate natural language. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data and use complex architectures like Transformers to perform various tasks such as translation, summarization, and answering questions.

### **Why LLMs are Important:**
- They provide a way to scale language-based solutions across multiple industries.
- LLMs power many of today's intelligent systems such as chatbots, language translation tools, and content generation platforms.
- Fine-tuning LLMs allows for domain-specific applications like legal document analysis, healthcare diagnostics, etc.

## **Big Data Problems: Characteristics**

- Large volumes of data (terabytes or petabytes).
- Requires high computational power for processing.
- High variability in the data (text, image, audio).
- Complex relationships within data.
  
## **Small Data Problems: Characteristics**

- Limited data availability (megabytes or gigabytes).
- Difficult to train sophisticated models due to lack of diverse information.
- Requires transfer learning or data augmentation techniques to improve accuracy.

## **The Rise of Deep Learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

### **Historical Milestones:**
- **2001:** Learning probabilities over a sequence of words (e.g., n-grams).
- **2013:** Grouping words with similar meanings based on the context (e.g., Word2Vec).
- **2015:** Preserving word context by assigning weights relative to other words (e.g., Attention mechanisms).
- **2018:** Learning language through exposure to large-scale corpora (e.g., the internet) to develop highly accurate LLMs (e.g., BERT, GPT).

The key idea is to create a **baseline model** from where specific use cases can be developed by fine-tuning or modifying existing architectures.

---

## **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**

RNNs were developed to solve the problem of input memorization in traditional Neural Networks by using loops to remember sequences over time.

### **Types of RNN Architectures:**

- **One-to-One:** Single input, single output (e.g., Image Classification).
- **One-to-Many:** Single input, sequence output (e.g., Image Captioning).
- **Many-to-One:** Sequence input, single output (e.g., Sentiment Analysis).
- **Many-to-Many:** Sequence input, sequence output (e.g., Machine Translation, Summarization).

---

### **Text Generation with RNNs**

- **Many-to-One (One Character at a Time):** Used for Sentiment Analysis, where a sequence of words is reduced to a sentiment label.
- **Many-to-Many (Full Sentences):** Used for tasks like Machine Translation, where full sentences are input and output in different languages.
- **Many-to-Many (Full Sentences):** Used for Text Summarization, where long input text is reduced to a summary.

---

## **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**

This architecture sets the standard for modern LLMs by using two networks:
- **Encoder:** Processes the input sequence and compresses it into a context vector.
- **Decoder:** Generates the output sequence from the context vector.

**Diagram (Textual Representation):**




This architecture is used in various applications like machine translation and summarization.

---

## **What's Under the Hood of RNNs?**

- **Machine Translation with RNNs:** The use of RNN-based architectures in translation tasks helped model long sequences of words in different languages.
  
- **Problems with RNNs:**
  - **Cannot be trained in parallel:** Due to sequential nature, RNNs must be trained one step at a time.
  - **Long Range Dependency:** RNNs struggle with long sequences as they tend to forget information over time.
  - **Sequential Processing:** RNNs process sequences one word at a time, making them slower than modern architectures.

---

## **Challenges of Understanding Language**

- **Language Complexity:** Words can have multiple meanings depending on context.
- **Beyond Word Sequences:** Merely memorizing word sequences isn't enough; a model must understand the broader context in which words are used.

---

## **The Breakthrough: "Attention Is All You Need"**

The **Transformer architecture** revolutionized NLP with its attention mechanism, allowing models to understand the entire context of a sentence by focusing on relevant parts of the input sequence. This led to faster, more accurate LLMs that can be trained in parallel and handle long-range dependencies efficiently.

**Diagram (Textual Representation):**


# **Attention is All You Need**

## **Transformers to the Rescue!**

Transformers are a breakthrough architecture in NLP, designed to solve the shortcomings of RNNs and improve scalability, parallelization, and contextual understanding.

### **Key Advantages of Transformers:**

- **Scale Efficiently:** They handle large datasets without the bottlenecks of RNNs or LSTMs.
- **Parallelization:** Unlike RNNs, transformers process words simultaneously, allowing for faster training.
- **Better Contextual Learning:** The self-attention mechanism allows transformers to understand the context of each word relative to the entire sentence.

---

## **Self-Attention Mechanism:**

Self-attention enables the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when encoding a specific word.

**Example Sentence:**  
*The teacher taught the student with the book.*

In the self-attention mechanism, each word can "attend" to other words in the sentence. Here's how each word might connect in the self-attention process:

- **The** → [teacher, taught, student, with, book]
- **Teacher** → [the, taught, student, with, book]
- **Taught** → [the, teacher, student, with, book]
- **Student** → [the, teacher, taught, with, book]
- **With** → [the, teacher, taught, student, book]
- **Book** → [the, teacher, taught, student, with]

The self-attention mechanism calculates the relationship between each word and all other words in the sentence to understand the full context.

---

## **Transformer Architecture**

**Diagram:**



- **Encoder:** Processes the entire input sequence and generates a contextual representation for each token.
- **Decoder:** Uses the encoder’s output and generates the final sequence step by step, attending to both previous outputs and encoder’s representation.

---

## **Tokenization in Transformers**

Transformers only work with **numerical input**, which means text has to be converted into numbers using a **tokenizer**.

### **Transforming Text Inputs:**

For example, the sentence **“The teacher taught the student”** is tokenized into numerical representations:

| Token ID | Word      |
|----------|-----------|
| 220      | The       |
| 432      | Teacher   |
| 857      | Taught    |
| 220      | the       |

Each word is mapped to a specific token ID.

---

## **Types of Tokenizers**

### 1. **Word-Based Tokenization**
This approach splits the sentence by words and assigns a unique token to each word.

| Token ID | Word      |
|----------|-----------|
| 220      | The       |
| 432      | Teacher   |
| 857      | Taught    |
| 122      | the       |

Example:
- "Let's Create Tokens now" would be tokenized as:
  
  | Token ID | Word     |
  |----------|----------|
  | 120      | Let's    |
  | 302      | Create   |
  | 417      | Tokens   |
  | 189      | now      |

**Limitations:**
- **Vocabulary Size:** Large models require thousands of unique tokens.
- **Unknown Words (OOV):** Any word not in the vocabulary becomes a problem and is treated as "unknown."

### 2. **Subword-Based Tokenization**
Instead of splitting words fully, it breaks words into **subword units**. This addresses the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issue by breaking down unfamiliar words into known subword pieces.

For example:
- **UncommonWord** might be split as:
  - `Uncommon` → `Un`, `common`, `Word`

### 3. **Character-Based Tokenization**
This approach treats each character as a token. It can handle any input but results in longer sequences.

For example:
- **"Taught"** would be tokenized as:
  - `T`, `a`, `u`, `g`, `h`, `t`

### **Tokenization Example and Comparison:**

#### **Word-Based:**
| Token ID | Word   |
|----------|--------|
| 220      | The    |
| 432      | Teacher|
| 857      | Taught |

#### **Character-Based:**
| Token ID | Character |
|----------|-----------|
| 12       | T         |
| 45       | h         |
| 17       | e         |

#### **Subword-Based:**
| Token ID | Subword   |
|----------|-----------|
| 220      | Teach     |
| 122      | -er       |

---

## **Conclusion**

Transformers revolutionized NLP by introducing attention mechanisms, allowing models to focus on relevant parts of the input. The tokenization techniques play a crucial role in enabling these models to handle diverse language inputs efficiently. By converting words into numerical representations and applying self-attention, Transformers achieve unparalleled performance in tasks like translation, summarization, and more.



# **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)**

**Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)** is an iterative approach that starts from pre-tokenization and continues until an optimal vocabulary is created based on the frequency of token pairs. BPE is particularly useful for compressing the vocabulary size while still capturing frequent word patterns.

### **How BPE Works:**
1. **Pre-tokenization:** The sentence is first split into characters or subwords.
2. **Pairing based on frequency:** The algorithm finds the most frequent pair of characters or subwords in the corpus and merges them into a single unit.
3. **Repeat:** The process repeats until a predefined vocabulary size is reached.

Example:
- "The teacher taught the student" might start as:
  - `T` `h` `e` `t` `e` `a` `c` `h` `e` `r`
  - BPE merges "th" to form "th" and repeats based on frequency.

# **SentencePiece**

**SentencePiece** treats the input as a continuous raw data stream without assuming spaces as word separators. It applies techniques such as **BPE** or **Unigram** to segment the text.

### **Advantages of SentencePiece:**
- **Space-Free Input:** It can handle languages like Japanese, Chinese, or texts with no explicit spaces.
- **Versatility:** It can be combined with different tokenization techniques like BPE and unigram models.

---

# **Embeddings**

Embeddings transform tokens into **trainable vectors** in a higher-dimensional space. These vectors capture semantic meanings and relationships between words in the input.

### **Intuition:**
- **Embeddings** encode the context of a token within a sentence.
- Each token is represented in a **unique space**, and similar words will have closer distances.

### **Example of Embeddings:**

| Token ID | Word      | Embedding Vector (Illustrative) |
|----------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| 220      | The       | [0.2, 0.1, 0.4, 0.7]            |
| 432      | Teacher   | [0.5, 0.8, 0.2, 0.9]            |
| 857      | Taught    | [0.6, 0.3, 0.4, 0.8]            |
| 122      | the       | [0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.6]            |

### **Word Embedding Distance Diagram**

Visualizing the distance between word embeddings (smaller distance indicates similar context):

-- [Teacher]------[Taught]------[Student] \ / \ / [The]-----------------[Book]


In the embedding space, **Teacher**, **Taught**, and **Student** are closer to each other, indicating they are contextually related.

---

# **Transformer Architecture**

Transformers consist of two main components:
1. **Encoder**
2. **Decoder**

Transformers can handle complex dependencies through self-attention mechanisms, allowing the model to consider the entire sequence at once.

### **Encoder Internals**

The encoder's inputs first flow through a **self-attention layer**, allowing it to look at other words in the sentence while encoding each specific word.

**Encoder Diagram:**


---

### **Decoder Internals**

The decoder uses both self-attention and an additional attention layer to focus on the encoder’s output, helping it generate relevant outputs.

**Decoder Diagram:**



---

# **Summary of Encoder and Decoder**

- **Encoder:**
  - Encodes input sequences and produces a vector per token with contextual understanding.
- **Decoder:**
  - Accepts inputs and generates new tokens step by step, focusing on relevant input parts.

# **Model Types**

### 1. **Encoder-Only Models**
- **Task:** These models are used for tasks like sentiment analysis.
- **Characteristic:** Input and output lengths are the same.
- **Example:** BERT
- **Use Case:** Sentiment analysis, classification tasks.

### 2. **Encoder-Decoder Models**
- **Task:** Used for tasks like machine translation where input and output lengths differ.
- **Characteristic:** Input length ≠ Output length.
- **Example:** BERT, T5
- **Use Case:** Machine translation, summarization.

### 3. **Decoder-Only Models**
- **Task:** These models are commonly used for text generation tasks.
- **Characteristic:** Popular in generative models.
- **Example:** GPT, LLaMA
- **Use Case:** Text generation, chatbots, creative writing.

---

# **Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)**

**GPT** models are **decoder-only** models consisting of stacks of decoder blocks. They use self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward networks to generate text outputs.

### **Key Characteristics of GPT:**
- **Self-attention:** Helps maintain relationships between tokens and context.
- **Feed-forward networks:** Process the transformed input at each stage.
- **Generative model:** Most popular for tasks like text generation.

# **Text Generation**

In recent years, **open-ended language generation** has gained significant attention, largely due to the rise of large transformer-based language models like **OpenAI's ChatGPT** and **Meta's LLaMA**. These models are trained on massive corpora, including millions of webpages, and are capable of handling a variety of tasks. They can generalize to unseen tasks, process code, and even take non-textual data as input. 

Alongside improvements in **transformer architecture** and the use of **massive unsupervised training data**, better **decoding methods** have also played a crucial role in generating coherent and contextually appropriate text.

---

## **Decoding Methods**

### 1. **Greedy Search**
**Greedy Search** is the simplest decoding method for text generation. In this method, the model selects the word with the highest probability at each step to generate the next word.

- **Pros:** Simple and fast.
- **Cons:** Can result in suboptimal text as it does not account for the global context of the entire sentence. The model might miss better sequences with slightly lower immediate probabilities.

### **Example:**
Suppose we are generating a sentence starting with: **"The cat is"**
- Greedy Search might choose: **"The cat is sleeping"** (because "sleeping" had the highest probability after "is").

---

### 2. **Beam Search**
**Beam Search** improves on Greedy Search by considering multiple hypotheses at each step. It keeps track of the `num_beams` most likely sequences and eventually selects the one with the highest overall probability.

- **num_beams:** This determines how many different hypotheses are kept at each time step.
- **Pros:** Reduces the risk of missing high-probability word sequences.
- **Cons:** Computationally expensive and can still generate repetitive or dull text.

### **Illustration: Beam Search with num_beams = 2**

Let’s assume we're generating text starting with: **"The cat is"**

| Time Step 1 | Time Step 2          | Hypotheses               |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| The         | The cat is sleeping   | Hypothesis 1 (chosen)    |
| The         | The cat is purring    | Hypothesis 2 (next best) |

Beam Search keeps two possibilities ("sleeping" and "purring"), and based on further probabilities, it may choose the best one in subsequent steps.

---

### 3. **Sampling**
**Sampling** refers to randomly selecting the next word from the probability distribution predicted by the model.

- **Pros:** Adds variability and diversity to text generation.
- **Cons:** The generated text can be incoherent or irrelevant, especially with highly uncertain models.

### **Example:**
If the model provides probabilities like:
- "The cat is" -> `0.4: sleeping`, `0.3: purring`, `0.2: running`, `0.1: barking`

Sampling might randomly select "purring" or "running," adding diversity compared to deterministic methods like Greedy Search.

---

### 4. **Top-K Sampling**
In **Top-K Sampling**, instead of considering all possible words in the vocabulary, the top **K** most likely words are chosen, and the probability mass is redistributed among them.

- **Pros:** Filters out unlikely candidates, making the generation more controlled.
- **Cons:** If K is too small, it might lead to repetitive or overly constrained text.

**Example:**
- K = 3, Top 3 words: `"sleeping"`, `"purring"`, `"running"`
- The model will then randomly sample from these three words.

**GPT-2** uses **Top-K Sampling**, which helped improve its performance in story generation and other creative tasks.

---

### 5. **Top-P (Nucleus) Sampling**
**Top-P Sampling** (also known as **Nucleus Sampling**) dynamically adjusts the number of words to sample from. Instead of choosing a fixed K, it selects the smallest set of words whose cumulative probability exceeds **P** (e.g., 90%). The probability mass is then redistributed among this set of words.

- **Pros:** Balances the strengths of both greedy and sampling methods. It can handle highly predictable and highly uncertain distributions more flexibly.
- **Cons:** Slightly more complex to implement but often provides better results in open-ended tasks.

**Example:**
- P = 0.9: This means that the model will sample from the smallest set of words whose total probability is greater than 90%.
  - If "sleeping" = 0.4, "purring" = 0.3, "running" = 0.2, then these three words will be selected, and one will be sampled based on their probabilities.

---

## **Which Decoding Method is Best?**

The choice of decoding method depends on the specific task and desired outcome:

- **Greedy Search:** Fast and simple, but often leads to repetitive or low-quality output. It’s best for constrained tasks where precision matters over creativity.
- **Beam Search:** Widely used for translation tasks or tasks where coherence is critical, but it can produce boring or repetitive text.
- **Sampling:** Adds randomness and creativity but can lead to incoherent results.
- **Top-K Sampling:** A more controlled version of sampling, useful for creative applications like story generation.
- **Top-P Sampling:** Often seen as the best compromise. It dynamically adjusts the set of candidate words, allowing for both control and diversity in text generation. It is highly favored for open-ended generation tasks like storytelling or dialogue systems.

### **Recommendation:**
- **Top-P Sampling** is generally preferred for **open-ended text generation** (e.g., stories, dialogue) due to its dynamic selection of tokens and flexibility.
- **Top-K Sampling** is also a popular choice for creative tasks, such as **GPT-2**’s story generation.

--- 

## **Conclusion**

Understanding how different decoding methods work is critical when fine-tuning large language models for text generation tasks. Each method has its pros and cons, and the choice of method will depend on the balance between coherence, diversity, and computational resources.
