# Customer Support App

This project leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Langchain to build an intelligent customer support application. By combining prompt engineering and Langchain components, we aim to automate and enhance the support experience, allowing efficient problem-solving through AI.

## 1. Power of LLMs

Language models are revolutionizing problem-solving, enabling automation of complex tasks with ease. By using **prompt engineering**, we can harness this power effectively.

### Key Features:
- **Pre-Trained LLMs**: These models can generalize to unseen tasks, making them highly adaptable for a wide range of applications.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Carefully designed prompts guide the LLM to produce relevant and accurate responses.

### Anatomy of a Prompt
A well-constructed prompt consists of the following components:
- **Context / Background**: Setup that clarifies intent, role play, expertise, or examples.
- **Instructions**: Specifics on what and how to perform the task (e.g., "Explain in simple language" or "Provide the output in a table format").
- **Task**: The action, such as creating, summarizing, solving, or responding.
- **Refine**: Follow-up validations, modifications, or additional clarifications.

### Example Prompt Breakdown:

1. **Context**: "You are an AI assistant with expertise in customer support. You will help solve technical issues."
2. **Instructions**: "Explain the process of resetting a router to an 8-year-old in simple steps."
3. **Task**: "Provide a step-by-step guide on how to reset the router."
4. **Refine**: "If the user asks about troubleshooting further, suggest calling their ISP for help."

## 2. Langchain

**Langchain** provides a powerful framework for building complex applications by chaining together different components. It simplifies integration between various modules and tools, which can be combined to enhance AI-driven tasks.

### Langchain Modules:
1. **Prompt Template**: Pre-defined prompts to ensure consistency and context across interactions.
2. **LLMs**: The core language models that handle the heavy lifting of generating responses.
3. **Agents**: Specialized logic flows that decide what steps to take based on the input.
4. **Memory**: Used to maintain context between interactions and create more coherent, human-like dialogues.

### Agent and Tools Workflow:

1. **User Input**: The user asks a question.
2. **Agent**: Interprets the query and decides what to do.
3. **Tools**: (e.g., Database, Internet, Documentation) Used to search for relevant information.
4. **Agent Response**: The agent processes the retrieved data and provides a solution.

## 3. Langchain Documentation

Start with the **Langchain Cookbook** for examples and detailed instructions on how to use Langchain for a variety of applications. This is the ideal starting point for anyone looking to get hands-on experience with the library.

### Key Langchain Components:
- **Modules**: Modular components like prompt templates, agents, and memory, each serving different roles in the application architecture.
- **Langserve**: A deployment layer to serve Langchain models in production environments.
- **Langsmith**: A suite of development and debugging tools that allow you to test, trace, and improve your chains in real-time.
